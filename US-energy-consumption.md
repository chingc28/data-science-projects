## Energy Generation in the US From 2001 to 2021 

### Introduction 

With the pressing concerns of climate change and global warming, this data visualization endeavors to reveal energy trends over the past 20 years at both the national and state levels. Its purpose is to depict the evolution of energy reliance, distinguishing between sources that emit greenhouse gases (e.g., coal) and those that are carbon neutral (e.g., hydroelectricity). By studying these visualizations, the information can be utilized to further investigate the effectiveness of renewable energy policies, the impact of shifting energy consumption patterns on greenhouse gas emissions, or the potential for transitioning to a more sustainable energy mix.

as well as interactive dashboard that allows users to examine specific states and source of energy 

### Findings 

In the past two decades, Texas has emerged as the leading energy generator in the U.S, producing a staggering 36.6 billion MWh. Florida claims the second position with approximately 9 billion MWh generated during the same period. Notably, since 2007, there has been a significant shift in energy consumption trends, with a decline in coal usage and a corresponding rise in natural gas utilization. Furthermore, petroleum oil has fallen out of favor as a primary energy source, experiencing a substantial decrease from 500 million MWh in 2001 to a mere 75 million MWh in 2021.

The use of wind and solar energy has also increased over the years, while hydroelectric and nuclear energy has stayed relatively the same.

Florida's reliance on petroleum oil has declined over the years, while Texas continues to hold the top spot in coal consumption. However, Texas primarily derives its energy from natural gas consumption, and its reliance on coal has significantly diminished since 2017. In fact, wind power surpassed coal as the second-largest source of energy generation in Texas in 2020.

Midwestern states like Illinois and Kansas predominantly utilize non-greenhouse-gas emitting sources such as nuclear power in Illinois and wind power in Kansas for their energy needs.

On the West Coast, Washington, Oregon, and Idaho rely on hydroelectric power for energy generation. While California's primary energy source is natural gas, solar energy has recently emerged as its leading renewable energy source as of 2020.Florida has used the most on petroleum oil but decreased over the years. Texas remains first place in coal consumption, while Pennsylvania relies much on hydroelectricity and nuclear energy as a form of renewable energy source.

### Conclusions and Future Work 

Given the significant decline in coal usage and the rise of natural gas as a primary energy source, further exploration can be undertaken to evaluate the environmental impact of this transition. It is crucial to assess whether the increased reliance on natural gas truly offers a more sustainable alternative or if it poses challenges such as methane emissions.

The increasing utilization of wind and solar energy presents opportunities for investment and development in renewable technologies. As these sources become more prominent, understanding their scalability, cost-effectiveness, and potential integration with existing energy infrastructure will be crucial. Additionally, the examples of states like Illinois and Kansas highlight the importance of regional factors in shaping energy portfolios. Exploring the reasons behind their specific energy choices and studying their successes and challenges can provide valuable insights for other states aiming to diversify their energy sources.

In conclusion, the analysis of energy trends over the past two decades underscores the need for continued research and collaboration in shaping a sustainable energy future. By leveraging these insights, policymakers and stakeholders can work together to formulate effective renewable energy policies, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and transition to a cleaner and more resilient energy landscape.
