## Energy Generation in the US From 2001 to 2021 

### Introduction 

With issues of climate change and global warming, this data visualization aims to uncover energy trends in the last 20 years with the country
as a whole and individual states. It is intended to visualize reliance on the type of energy over the years, either energy sources that 
emits greenhouse gas (e.g. coal) or sources that are carbon neutral (e.g. hydroelectricity). Through these visualizations, the information 
can be used to further examine [blank] 

### Tableau Public 

The link to the full dashboard on Tableau Public can be found and downloaded through this [link](https://public.tableau.com/views/US_Energy/Story1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link). The story dashboard contains source of data, 
as well as interactive dashboard that allows users to examine specific states and source of energy 

### Findings 

Texas generated the most amount of energy at 36.6 billion MWh in the last 20 years combined, with Florida being 2nd place at about 9 billion MWh. 
Since 2007, the consumption of coal has decreased whlie usage of natural gas has increased. Petroleum oil has also been unfavored as a source of 
energy generation. It produced 500 million MWh in 2001 and decreased down to 75 million in 2021.
