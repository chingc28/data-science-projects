# Data Science Projects

These are projects where I've worked with data visualization, data analysis, and machine learning either as a personal project, research, or as a classroom
assignment! I'm a microbiologist by training but fell in love with data science during my very first python programming course in my undergraduate junior year. Now I
work with machine learning and deep learning algorithms to research and design therapeutics for cancer drugs! I enjoy creating infomative yet fun data visualization for a broader audience as well as analyzing data to help inform people and aid in their decision making.

My passion projects includes analysis of trends in health and disease, macroeconomics, and predictive modelling on big data in media.
