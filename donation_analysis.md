## Data Analysis and Visualization of Donations Made by the Gates Foundation 

### Introduction 

The Gates Foundation is known for their generous philanthropy, from fighting malaria to improving childhood education. The purpose of this analysis is to
visualize the countries these fundings are going to, the cause, and the trend of donations made over time. The report used for this analysis can be found
here on the [Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation website](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/committed-grants). It is important to note that the data is updated
frequently and the time this report was downloaded for analysis was on April 28, 2023.

### Software used for analysis: 
- Tableau 
- Microsoft Excel

### Workbook 

Link for the complete and interactive Tableau workbook can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/DashboardofBillMelindaGatesFoundationDonations/Story1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link), with the file being available to download 

### Analysis
This quick overview of the dashboard shows: 
- Most of the donation goes towards Global Development and Global Health 
- Out of non-US countries, Switzerland received the highest donations
- The Foundation committed the most amount of money in 2016, at over $6 billion

- The World Health Organization (WHO) received the highest donations out of every grantee
- The highest amount given to an organization in a single year is the GAVI Alliance in 2021, organization with a mission to give 
vaccines to the world's poorest countries 
- The University of Washington receives the most amount of funding in the Global Health division

### Future

In the future, I hope to add to this analysis by adding subtopic data for each division (e.g. Malarial vaccine under the global health division). I hope that
by creating this visualization, it can provide insight into the trends of donations overtime, encourage philathropy in areas most needed, and geographical locations
that may require more philathropic efforts
